     * <b>Note</b>: This method is intended to address a rare but serious
     * condition where network partitions can cause threads issuing JDBC calls
     * to hang uninterruptedly in socket reads, until the OS TCP-TIMEOUT
     * (typically 10 minutes). This method is related to the
     * {@link #abort abort() } method which provides an administrator
     * thread a means to free any such threads in cases where the
     * JDBC connection is accessible to the administrator thread.
     * The {@code setNetworkTimeout} method will cover cases where
     * there is no administrator thread, or it has no access to the
     * connection. This method is severe in it's effects, and should be
     * given a high enough value so it is never triggered before any more
     * normal timeouts, such as transaction timeouts.
     * <p>
     * JDBC driver implementations  may also choose to support the
     * {@code setNetworkTimeout} method to impose a limit on database
     * response time, in environments where no network is present.
     * <p>
     * Drivers may internally implement some or all of their API calls with
     * multiple internal driver-database transmissions, and it is left to the
     * driver implementation to determine whether the limit will be
     * applied always to the response to the API call, or to any
     * single  request made during the API call.
     * <p>
     * <p>
     * This method can be invoked more than once, such as to set a limit for an
     * area of JDBC code, and to reset to the default on exit from this area.
     * Invocation of this method has no impact on already outstanding
     * requests.
     * <p>
     * The {@code Statement.setQueryTimeout()} timeout value is independent of the
     * timeout value specified in {@code setNetworkTimeout}. If the query timeout
     * expires  before the network timeout then the
     * statement execution will be canceled. If the network is still
     * active the result will be that both the statement and connection
     * the query timeout or if the statement timeout fails due to network
     * problems, the connection will be marked as closed, any resources held by
     * the connection will be released and both the connection and
     * statement will be unusable.
     * <p>
     * When the driver determines that the {@code setNetworkTimeout} timeout
     * value has expired, the JDBC driver marks the connection
     * closed and releases any resources held by the connection.

     *                     completes, a SQLException will be thrown.
